I never really considered it, but every image you see of The Asteroid Belt is an illustration... an interpretation at best. The belt is not jam-packed with huge boulders that are continually bumping into each other. From any given asteroid, you might not even be able to see your nearest neighbor.

Then another thought arose. If an atom's nucleus was to be the size of an orange, then the atom would be about the size of New York City. So just like asteroids in the asteroid belt, the distance between an atom and its nucleus is just as unfathomable. Can you comprehend that? Do you see you're nothing but Space? Yeah, you feel solid, but you can't deny that you are made up of the same thing that separates one asteroid from another.
