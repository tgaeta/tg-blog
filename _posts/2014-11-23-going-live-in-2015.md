Hello, World! I'm Tony Gaeta and I will soon start a new chapter in my life. I currently work for the intelligence community as an intelligence analyst; however, I will retire the spy game to become a student at The Iron Yard Tampa. The Iron Yard is an academy that transforms students into real-world full-stack developers. I'm extremely excited about the journey that lies ahead and I will begin to blog about it starting in the New Year.
