Hi! I’m Tony. I build websites and web apps from time to time. When I’m not near a computer, you can find me running along the water in St. Pete, FL watching the sunrise, taking pictures of whatever is interesting at the moment, reading, and spending quality time with my wife and two boys.

I would love to work with a team that focuses on test-driven development, code maintainability, and has a product-driven mindset.
