Tony hails from St. Petersburg, Florida, just outside of Tampa. It was while leading a team of intelligence analysts at The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) that he realized his aptitude for coding. Blending his technical and creative talents with his desire to learn, web development soon became the focus of his career. He left the intelligence community in 2014 and never looked back.

He would love to work for a team that focuses on test driven development, code maintainability, and has a product-driven mindset. The primary technologies he's most comfortable with is Ruby on Rails, Ruby, PostgreSQL, Javascript, HTML/HAML, and CSS/SASS.
